#Â GPG on Yubikeys

When using physical tokens we want to have a different signing key on each token, however have a common encryption/decription key on both tokens.  The reason for having a common encryption/decription key on both tokens is that we must make it easy for others to send us encrypted messages and not require them to have any knoweldge of our GPG setup.
