#Â Automate GPG hierarchy creation, optionally on Yubikey(s) and/or SmartCard(s)

## Quick start

These steps will prepare two SmartCards with secret subkeys, paperkey backups
that can be printed, and a revocation certificate in case the master key is
lost.

1. Generate keys - this step is ideally run on an air gapped device

        make default

    The above command will:

      1. Set up a local soft master key
      2. Generate a soft encryption key locally
      3. Start the gpg interactive interface to:
        a) create signing and auth keys directly on the card
        b) load the soft encryption key onto the card
        c) extract the SSH public key from the card
      4. Re-import the prevoiusly generated encryption key locally
      5. Repeat step 3 to set up a second smartcard (optionally)
      6. Test the encryption, signing, decryption & validation

2. Copy following files for use on main device

        $(GNUPGHOME)/.data/id_rsa.pub
        $(GNUPGHOME)/.data/subkeys.asc

3. Optionally store your revocation certificate somewhere safe and separate to
   your master key.

        $(GNUPGHOME)/openpgp-revocs.d

4. Import subkeys to main device

      For the first device:

        SUBKEYS=/path/to/subkeys.asc make import-ssb

      Then for the second device you only need to link the keys by calling:

        gpg --card-status

## Overview

There are numerous well written guides that describe how to manually generate
a GPG key set.  The aim of this work is to automate that so you can generate
and import such a key set with minimal effort.

The goal is to have a structure as follows for your day to day use such that
the master secret key is only stored on cold storage and all the private sub
keys are either soft keys in your regular ~/.gnupg keyring, or are stored on
a yubikey or other PGP/GPG SmartCard.

    sec#  rsa4096 2017-06-26 [C] [expires: 2022-06-25]
          D49147668E74D68C108A83DB53E708995F9835CD
    uid           [ultimate] REAL NAME (https://keybase.io/userid) <user@emailaddr.ess>
    ssb>  rsa2048 2017-06-26 [E] [expires: 2019-06-26]
    ssb>  rsa4096 2017-06-26 [S] [expires: 2019-06-26]
    ssb>  rsa4096 2017-06-26 [A] [expires: 2019-06-26]

In the above example we can make the following observations:

- the `#` in `sec#` indicates the private key part of the master key is not
  available locally
- the `[C]` indicates the master key is only capable of certification
- signing (`[S]`), encryption (`[E]`) and authentication (`[A]`) are all
  achieved by the individual subkeys
- the `>` in `ssb>` indicates the private key for each subkey is stored on
  a SmartCard or Yubikey.
- the encryption key is 2048 bit so that it can be shared between multiple
  cards, among which the lowest common support is 2048 bit keys
- the signing and authentication keys are 4096 bit as they're generated on the
  card at the maximum supported bits for that specific card

## Master key

The master key is a soft key only capable of certification and should not be
stored on a device used daily.  It's a good idea to keep this safe on an
encrypted USB device, and even better to have a print out of it, as is
prepared by paperkey.

The generate master key backups are stored at:

  - $(GNUPGHOME)/.data/key-master.asc
  - $(GNUPGHOME)/.data/paperkey-master.txt

## Signing, authentication and encryption sub keys

When using physical tokens we want to have a different signing and
authentication keys on each token so that in the event one SmartCard is lost
we only need to revoke that single key set of that SmartCard.

However for the encryption key it's most convenient to have the same subkey
used on both tokens as that makes it easy for others to send us encrypted
messages and not require them to have any knoweldge of our GPG key structure.

For these reasons we generate the encryption key as a soft key that is
transferred to the SmartCard(s), while we generate the signing and
authentication keys directly on the cards.

If you don't have a SmartCard then you can generate all the keys as soft keys
using the following command:

    make softkeys

Storing and keeping the soft keys safe is essentially the same as when using
a SmartCard.

## Cold storage of the master key and revocation certificates

Ideally all your key material will be generated on an air gapped device.  If
you use an ephemeral system for this, such as Tails, you'll need to keep your
master key and revocation certificates on a couple of USB sticks.  You should
probably use SLC (Single Layer Cell) USB sticks as they should be more
resilient, and you should probably print out the paperkey representations of
all private key material.

## To do

- Manage key expiry extention.  As of GPG 2.1 only master keys can be
  automated with --quick-set-expire.
- Add tests to validate all resulting artefacts are as expected, for example
  the exported ASCII armored private key and subkeys are well structured and
  encrypted, and the SSH public key is exported correctly.
- When GnuPG supports automation of card key generation this will need to be
  implemented.

## Known issues

### GPG max key size

GPG has a hard max key size of 4096bit.  Apparently the brew version has upped
this to 8192bit.  You can try that if you desire, however keep in mind that
most SmartCards only support 2048bit, while a few now support 4096bit.

### gpg-agent socket path length limit

As of GnuPG 2.1 the key handling logic has been entirely moved out of the old
`gpg` binary and into `gpg-agent`.  As a result `gpg-agent` will be invoked
automatically as needed, and therefore the `gpg-agent` socket will always be
used for communication between the `gpg` command line interface and the
running `gpg-agent`.  Unfortunately sockets on Unix systems have a hard limit
of 108 characters in their path, including macOS.  This is not a limitation of
GnuPG but rather of the underlying OS, and `gpg` may fail slightly cryptically
if the path is longer than 108 characters.
